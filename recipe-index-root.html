Jack is already prepping the dough, and later, I’ll be in charge of the toppings. When it comes to pizza toppings, I certainly have a few favorites (I’ll always use fresh basil, roasted tomatoes, and artichoke hearts if I have them on hand), but what I love most is coming up with new pizza topping ideas that I haven’t tried before.

If you’re new to working with yeast, the idea of making your own pizza dough might be intimidating, but I think you’ll find that it’s really simple. Anyone can master it! I’m sharing my best pizza dough recipe below. It’s been my go-to for years, and it’s&nbsp;fantastic for beginners. It’s easy to make with 6 basic ingredients, and it yields a soft, chewy, and flavorful pizza crust.

I’m not talking about store-bought frozen dinners, but the soups, stews, and casseroles that I make ahead and freeze myself. Stored and reheated the right way, these freezer meals are just as flavorful as they were on the day they were made. When I have a stash of them on hand, making a delicious, healthy dinner is as simple as heating one up! Below, you’ll find my favorite freezer meals to make ahead, along with my best…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These no-bake energy balls are my favorite healthy snack. Sticky, sweet, and studded with chocolate chips, they taste like little balls of cookie dough, but they’re made with simple, wholesome ingredients. Dates bind them together, oats add fiber, and walnuts and almond butter pack them with protein and healthy fats. They’re super-quick and easy to make in the food processor, and they keep for weeks in the freezer or fridge. At least they do in theory. If you love these energy balls as much as we do, there’s no way they’ll stick around that long. Between speedy breakfasts and on-the-go…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Where to start with this cauliflower pasta recipe?! Friends, this one’s a keeper. Caramelized roasted cauliflower mingles with ruffly pasta, capers, parsley, and toasty, lemony breadcrumbs. I love the mix of bright and briny flavors and how the tender cauliflower contrasts with the breadcrumbs’ crunch. The combination feels elevated, but don’t let it fool you. This cauliflower pasta is surprisingly simple to make. Jack and I ate it for dinner early last week…and then again last night. Can you tell that we’re hooked?

Don’t toss that stale bread on your counter. Use it to make homemade breadcrumbs instead! Up until recently, Jack and I rarely had stale bread hanging around the house. We just weren’t bread people. Every so often, we’d get a good crusty loaf to enjoy with a pot of soup, or Jack would make his own bread for a fun weekend project. But regular old sandwich bread? Nope, we never had it on hand. But over the last year or so, Jack has started making sandwiches for lunch instead of going out or ordering in like he used to.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I make roasted cauliflower almost every week. It’s SO simple, healthy, and absolutely delicious. The florets come out of the oven with crisp, golden brown edges and a rich, nutty flavor. They’re perfect for serving as a side dish, tossing into a salad, a grain bowl, or a pasta…or eating straight off the baking sheet. You’ll find my go-to roasted cauliflower recipe below, along with my best tips and tricks for cooking it perfectly every time. I’ve also shared a few of my favorite ways to serve roasted cauliflower.

They include a recipe for every classic muffin you can think of – blueberry, banana, zucchini, chocolate chip, and more – but they’re all made with wholesome ingredients like whole wheat flour, almond flour, Greek yogurt, and maple syrup. Still, they deliver everything you want in a muffin, healthy or otherwise. They’re moist, tender, puffy, and lightly sweet. Two (or three) for me, please!

They have a hearty base of brown rice, crispy tofu for plant-based protein, and roasted broccoli and radishes for color and crunch. Avocado adds creamy richness, and my go-to carrot-ginger dressing takes them over the top. They’re nourishing, satisfying, and, above all, delicious! They also happen to be perfect for meal prep. The dressing keeps well for up to a week, and you can cook the rice, tofu, and broccoli up to 3 days in advance. Store the components…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I know it’s just a simple sauce, but this carrot ginger dressing is still one of my favorite recipes on Love & Lemons. It’s creamy, zingy, vibrant, and bright, with a slight sweetness from the carrots and bite from the ginger. It calls for 6 ingredients (including salt and water!), and it keeps in the fridge for up to a week. I make a batch whenever I get the chance. This carrot ginger dressing is exactly what I want to drizzle over a grain bowl at lunchtime, toss with a side salad at dinner, or use as a dipping sauce…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Every time I make this air fryer broccoli, I wish I’d doubled the recipe. It’s so simple, but something about the combination of the broccoli’s crisp edges and savory, salty seasoning makes it completely addictive. Even if I intend to serve it as a side dish or add it to a grain bowl, I find myself eating it straight out of the air fryer basket. It’s that good!
