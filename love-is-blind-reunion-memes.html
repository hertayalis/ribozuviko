To no one's surprise, everyone was obsessed with Lauren on the show.</h2><p>The undeniable fan favorite couple on Love Is Blind was Lauren and Cameron. They were the first couple to get engaged (in Episode 1 no less) and they were both captivated by one another as soon as they met in person.&nbsp;</p><p>During the reunion, multiple men on the show revealed that they also had strong relationships with Lauren before Cameron got down on one knee.

Alas, during the reunion, Mark said a few things that implied that he might be interested in reconciling with his ex.

From the moment Carlton and Diamond met, it was clear that things were not going to end well for them. For starters, Carlton hadn't told Diamond about being bisexual yet, which ultimately made Diamond feel like he hadn't been fully open in the pods. When they broke up, Diamond's engagement ring was thrown in the pool, Diamond quoted Beyonce, and Carlton made fun of her wig.&nbsp;</p><p>On the reunion, the two seemed to patch things up. Carlton explained that he didn't ever think that Diamond was biphobic and that he was wrong for going off on her in the way that he did. For her part, Diamond said that she was just caught off guard with Carlton's announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>While some found Carlton's friendship proposal (with the ring retrieved from the pool) to be a nice moment, others found it to be too contrived.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me when Carlton was trying to gaslight Diamond.
