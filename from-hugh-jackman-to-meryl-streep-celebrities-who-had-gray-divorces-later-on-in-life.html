They hit it off instantly and tied the knot within the year, quickly becoming one of Hollywood’s most beloved couples. Upon announcing their divorce in 2023, in a<a href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;statement to PEOPLE</a>, the couple wrote, “We have been blessed to share almost three decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage. Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth.” The Wolverine star and Shame actress share two kids together, Oscar and Ava.</p><p class=GallerylistItemIndex_g1lcdhm8><span class=GallerylistItemIndexCurrent_g16bk40d>2</span><span class=GallerylistItemIndexTotal_gkchwpf>/9</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fcf2b91a0ce8-kevin-cosner-wife-christine-baumgartner.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner</h2><p dir=ltr>In May 2023,<a href=#>&nbsp;Kevin Costner’s</a> designer second wife filed for divorce after 18 years together.

They married in 2004 and have three kids together: Cayden, Hayes, and Grace. Their separation was not all smooth sailing; after rocky legal proceedings where the couple fought over child support payments and their prenup, they finalised their divorce in February 2024.</p><p class=GallerylistItemIndex_g1lcdhm8><span class=GallerylistItemIndexCurrent_g16bk40d>3</span><span class=GallerylistItemIndexTotal_gkchwpf>/9</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f3f35265ea64-meryl-streep-don-gummer.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Meryl Streep and Don Gummer</h2><p dir=ltr><a href=#>The Devil Wears Prada&nbsp;actress</a> and her sculptor hubby<a href=#>&nbsp;have been married</a> for a whopping 45 years and have four kids together: Henry Wolf, Mamie Gummer, Grace Gummer and Louisa Jacobson.

Just two years after their divorce, Caitlyn made headlines when she publicly<a href=#>&nbsp;came out as transgender</a> in an interview with Diane Sawyer, a revelation which the Kardashians claimed they had no knowledge of. Tensions escalated between Caitlyn and the Kardashian clan since releasing her<a href=#>&nbsp;tell-all book</a> in 2017, The Secrets of My Life, in which she claimed that Kris knew all along about her gender dysphoria: “She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn…I told her I dressed as a woman, and she knew I did because I did it several times in front of her after we were married.”</p><p class=GallerylistItemIndex_g1lcdhm8><span class=GallerylistItemIndexCurrent_g16bk40d>5</span><span class=GallerylistItemIndexTotal_gkchwpf>/9</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27746354a7ff-gettyimages-79106267.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Billy Ray and Tish Cyrus</h2><p dir=ltr><a href=#>Miley</a> and<a href=#>&nbsp;Noah’s</a> parents were married for an incredible 29 years before the curtains closed on their marriage in April 2022.

The pair met when Melinda worked for Microsoft as a product manager under Bill, who was, of course, the CEO. Their professional admiration for each other blossomed into romance, and they married in 1994. They started their charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in 2000, dedicated to eliminating global inequality, championing public health and improving education across the US. Their incredible work even earned them the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.
