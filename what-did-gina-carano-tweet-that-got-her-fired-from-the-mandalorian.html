The actress wowed Star Wars fans with her portrayal of special forces operative Cara Dune in The Mandalorian‚Äôs first season, and Disney had big plans for the character. Not only was she set to star in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rangers of the New Republic</a>, but Disney Plus‚Äôs focus on weaving the extended universe into a cohesive project meant she had movies and television appearances lined up for the next decade. Despite all of her success, Carano couldn‚Äôt stop herself from sharing whatever thought popped into her head on social media. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Her controversial online presence gained traction in 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The actress was a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vocal opponent</a> of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mask mandates</a>. Her Instagram and Twitter posts were mostly stupid memes but people were dying ‚Äì 350k Americans died of the disease in 2020 alone.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>Many right-wing talking heads flouted safety procedures and declared mask mandates violations of free speech ‚ÄìThe U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in February 2024 that medical mandates don‚Äôt fall under the protection of the 1st Amendment ‚Äì and Carano pushed the narrative. A vocal Republican, she frequently used her platform to espouse her political ideals, from <a href=#>endorsing the voter fraud conspiracy</a> around the 2020 election, to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">conspiracy theories</a> around Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs death.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>We need to clean up the election process so we are not left feeling the way we do today.<br>Put laws in place that protect us against voter fraud.<br>Investigate every state.<br>Film the counting.<br>Flush out the fake votes.<br>Require ID.<br>Make Voter Fraud end in 2020.<br>Fix the system. üá∫üá∏</p>‚Äî Gina Carano üïØ (@ginacarano) <a href=#>November 5, 2020</a></figure><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>Carano found herself in hot water after starting beef over the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter. The fight was sparked by a commenter telling Carano that protestors were ‚Äútrying to educate you so you can get on the right side of history,‚Äù <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the New York Post</a>. Carano responded,</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>‚ÄúIn my experience, screaming at someone that they are a racist when they are indeed NOT a racist & any post and/or research you do will show you those exact facts, then I‚Äôm sorry, these people are not ‚Äòeducators.‚Äô They are&nbsp;cowards and bullies.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=584 data-current-count=847 data-injectable=true>Despite ample warning and, by her own admission, Disney repeatedly requiring her to ‚Äúreview documentaries on any of these topics or speak to individuals with contrary points of view,‚Äù Carano continued to dig herself a hole. She refused to use pronouns in her Twitter bio, and while that rankled fan, the breaking point came when she addressed the issue by adding ‚Äúbeep/boop/boop‚Äù to her profile in response. The hashtag #FireGinaCarano had been liberally used by the social media site in the wake of her habitual sh*t-posting, but it took off in the wake of her ‚Äúprotest.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>We‚Äôre all for expressing yourself, but not to the detriment of roughly 1% of the population. As a former MMA fighter, you‚Äôd think Carano would understand the concept of punching down.

She went so far as to use him as an example in her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent lawsuit</a>, alluding to a post in which he compared immigrant children in cages to Nazi concentration camps as a comparison for her own Nazi-centric post. In her lawsuit she blames the disconnect on his gender identity.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>That‚Äôs right, Pascal can‚Äôt play the race card, but Carano can sure as heck lean on her womanhood. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Carano claimed that Disney was watching her like a hawk, and yet, it didn‚Äôt stop her from putting the final nail in her coffin.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The straw that broke the Bantha‚Äôs back</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Gina-Carano-Tweet-1.jpg><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">death rattle of Carano‚Äôs career</a> came after the actress compared her life as a Republican to the plight of Jews during the Holocaust.

She says that her gender and political ideologies are at the heart of this case, and that her male co-stars were never ‚Äúre-educated.‚Äù She also leans on the idea that her right to free speech was some how infringed upon.
