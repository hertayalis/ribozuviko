– Charles Milles Manson, born Charles Milles Maddox on November 12, 1934, was a notorious American criminal and musician who gained infamy as the leader of the Manson Family, a cult based in California during the late 1960s.</strong></p><p>Charles Manson’s followers committed a series of brutal murders in July and August 1969, including the horrific killing of the film actress Sharon Tate.</p><p>Before his criminal activities, Manson spent a significant portion of his life in correctional institutions. He was also involved in the fringes of the Los Angeles music industry as a singer-songwriter.</p><p>Through his chance connection with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys and subsequent interaction with record producer Terry Melcher, Manson had the opportunity to enter the music industry. Although the Beach Boys recorded one of his songs, “Cease to Exist,” it was released without crediting Manson. His attempts to secure a record contract were ultimately unsuccessful.</p><p>Charles Manson often spoke about the Beatles and drew inspiration from their music, particularly their self-titled 1968 album. He interpreted their lyrics in a way that fueled his apocalyptic ideology, which he referred to as “Helter Skelter.”</p><p>During his trial, it was argued that Charles Manson intended to incite a race war, although he and others disputed this claim. Some argued that the Tate-LaBianca murders were copycat crimes aimed at exonerating Manson’s friend Bobby Beausoleil. Manson himself denied directly instructing anyone to commit murder.</p><p>In terms of his parole hearings, Manson was repeatedly denied release due to his history of controlling behavior, mental health issues including schizophrenia and paranoid delusional disorder, and his refusal to show remorse or gain insight into his crimes. He was considered a significant danger and too great a risk to be released.</p><p>Manson’s notoriety extended beyond his criminal acts. He appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in June 1970, and his crimes influenced various individuals and groups.</p><p>Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground made controversial remarks about the Tate murders, and a Manson fanatic named James Mason founded a neo-Nazi group, inspired by Manson’s words in a televised interview. There were also claims of a “neo-Manson cult” in Europe, with numerous rock bands playing songs by Manson or in support of him.</p><p>Despite his criminal activities, Manson pursued a musical career during the late 1960s. While his music did not achieve mainstream success, there have been various releases of Manson’s recordings over the years, both musical and spoken.</p><p>Some notable examples include the album “LIE” released in 1970 and “The Family Jams,” featuring songs recorded by the Manson Family after their arrest in 1970. Additionally, several musicians, such as Guns N’ Roses and Marilyn Manson, have covered or referenced Manson’s songs in their own works. Manson’s name and his dark legacy have also influenced the names of musical performers like Kasabian, Spahn Ranch, and Marilyn Manson.</p><p>On January 1, 2017, Charles Manson, who was incarcerated at Corcoran Prison, was urgently transferred to Mercy Hospital in downtown Bakersfield due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Reports indicated that Manson’s health was severely compromised, and his doctors deemed him too frail for the required surgery under normal circumstances. Following medical treatment, Manson was returned to prison on January 6, 2017, although specific details about his treatment remained undisclosed.</p><p>Later in the year, on November 15, 2017, there were unofficial reports suggesting that Manson had been readmitted to a hospital in Bakersfield. However, due to medical privacy laws, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation neither confirmed nor denied this information. Tragically, on November 19, 2017, Manson passed away at the hospital from cardiac arrest caused by respiratory failure resulting from colon cancer.</p><p>Following Manson’s death, three individuals expressed their intention to claim his estate and body. Manson’s grandson, Jason Freeman, asserted his desire to take possession of Manson’s remains and personal belongings. Meanwhile, Manson’s pen-pal, Michael Channels, presented a will purportedly dated February 14, 2002, which designated him as the sole beneficiary of Manson’s estate and body. Another individual, Ben Gurecki, claimed to possess a will dated January 2017, allegedly naming Matthew Roberts, who is said to be Manson’s son, as the recipient of the estate and Manson’s body.</p><p>In 2012, CNN conducted a DNA test to determine if Freeman and Roberts were related, but the results showed no familial connection between them. Previous attempts to match Roberts’ DNA with genetic material from Manson were reportedly unsuccessful due to contamination. On March 12, 2018, the Kern County Superior Court in California ruled in favor of Freeman, granting him the rights to Manson’s body. Subsequently, Freeman had Manson cremated on March 20, 2018, bringing a conclusion to the legal dispute surrounding Manson’s remains.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Charles Manson’s Net Worth?</h2><p>At the time of his death, his net worth was not known.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsBur8eaqaWdo2K6orrSqKWsZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bala-bangles-shark-tank-net-worth-2024.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bala Bangles Shark Tank Net Worth 2024</a>
